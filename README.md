# Final Project
Check out `main.py` for how to run the project.
```
python main.py [--e2e]
```

With the `--e2e` flag, you can run the whole model on ResNet18, instead of simple dot products.
Check out the `DeiT` branch to try out a vision transformer.


## Reconfiguring
You can change the variables in `src/cross_talk.py::make_configuration` to create different configurations.
