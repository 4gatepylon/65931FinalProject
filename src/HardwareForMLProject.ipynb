        "# Outline of Clarifications to Ask\n",
        "## General Questions\n",
        "1. Level of Detail:\n",
        "    - It seems impossible to capture the noise without a semi-detailed step by step computation.\n",
        "    - Is this an overkill? What's the alternative? Looks like the proposal above seems basically good to go.\n",
        "2. Parameter Values:\n",
        "    - The paper does not specify all the values (e.g., feedback resistance at the PD, or crosstalk noise in PLCU MRRs)\n",
        "        - Do you know where to find them? TBD.\n",
        "        - Or can they be derived from the provided ones (e.g., MRR crosstalk from $k^2$ and FSR)? Look below for cross-talk for specifics.\n",
        "        - Or can we assume some 'ideal' default (e.g., the feedback resistance that would allow loss-less computation). Yes we can assume the ideal to begin with.\n",
        "3. Losses:\n",
        "    - In addition to noise, there are also losses.\n",
        "    - Do we ignore them, or do we take them into account? Answer: we should ignore them and we can justify this by mentioning that the losses are predictable. If the losses are not predictable then maybe we should model them.\n",
        "4. Cross-talk?\n",
        "    - Cross talk seems input dependent, meaning that the amount of noise depends on surrounding values (meaning receptive fields that are multiplexed in the same waveguide).\n",
        "    - Should we derive cross-talk for micro-ring resonator? Answer: We should try and if not we might not do it. Cross-talk is important.\n",
        "5. Do we assume constants or make something parameterized? Yes. Do not just hard-code.\n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "## Specific Questions\n",
        "### Input Conversion\n",
        "- I understand that quantized inputs are turned into voltages.\n",
        "    - With what precision? In what range? Just assume some sort of ideal if it's very much not defined from the paper (i.e. just don't model it).\n",
        "    - Like [0, 1.0]?\n",
        "- The voltage is then turned into an optical signal, after being multiplied by a 'gain' in (W/V).\n",
        "    - I can't find this value.\n",
        "    - I can assume defaults that match the output deconversion?\n",
        "- AWG (Arrayed Waveguide Grating) Crosstalk.\n",
        "    - This is given as a fixed value in the paper.\n",
        "    - Can we assume it?\n",
        "    - Isn't crosstalk input-dependent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weight Conversion\n",
        "- The paper expects weights to be in [-1, 1]. So I assume we have to manually scale down, then scale back up right?\n",
        "- What the weights become voltages, can we assume a perfect conversion?\n",
        "    - E.g., if the weight is $0.378934373$, the voltage can exactly match that.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Optical Dot Product\n",
        "- How to compute MRR cross-talk?\n",
        "    - We are given $k^2$ (cross-coupling factor) and FSR (free spectral range).\n",
        "    - It should input-dependent?\n",
        "- How to capture RIN (relative intensity noise)?\n",
        "    - The units we are given are decibels relative to the carrier per hertz (dBc/Hz)?\n",
        "        - The bandwidth (frequency?) is later given as 5GHz.\n",
        "- How to get the \"feedback resistance\"?\n",
        "    - Allows converting current to voltage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output Conversion\n",
        "- How do we map voltage back to integers.\n",
        "- Like:\n",
        "    - Can we assume some uniform mapping, from (V_min -> 0) and (V_max -> int_max).\n",
        "    - Are V_min and V_max fixed parameters, or do change input by input?\n",
        "        - I.e., does 1V always correspond to the same integer, is it relative to other voltage values in the output.\n",
        "- Same question about voltage precision.\n",
        "    - Can we assume perfect voltage precision, or is something lost."
